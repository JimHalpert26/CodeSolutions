/*
 * The airports can be considered as vertices and tickets as directed edges of 
 * a graph. Now since an itinerary is to be formed using all the tickets only 
 * once, so we can be assured that we need to find an Eulerian Path for this 
 * directed graph.
 * An Eulerian Path uses every edge in a graph only once.
